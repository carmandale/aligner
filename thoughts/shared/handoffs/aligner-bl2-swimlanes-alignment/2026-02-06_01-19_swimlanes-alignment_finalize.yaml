goal: "Add swimlane containers, improve edge routing, fix grid alignment for professional flowchart rendering"
now: "Implemented swimlanes, white background, fromSide/toSide edge routing, 5px snap grid, and light gray grid dots"

done_this_session:
  - "Added container/swimlane node type with large colored background rectangles"
  - "Containers render behind regular nodes via zIndex sorting"
  - "White canvas background for cleaner professional look"
  - "Added fromSide/toSide edge properties for explicit routing control"
  - "Reduced snap grid from 20px to 5px for precise center alignment"
  - "Fixed grid dots to light gray via CSS override (.react-flow__background pattern)"
  - "Added handles on all 4 sides of nodes for flexible edge connections"
  - "Updated groovetech-profile-media-flow.json with 3 swimlanes (Media Server, Cloud, GMP)"
  - "Changed edges from smoothstep to bezier for cleaner curves"

decisions:
  - "Use transparent/light gray grid dots instead of black (user preference)"
  - "5px snap grid allows center alignment of nodes with different widths"
  - "Swimlane colors: blue for Media Server, green for Cloud/GCS, purple for GMP/VisionOS"
  - "Edge routing controlled via JSON fromSide/toSide properties"

files:
  - "src/App.tsx - edge routing, snap grid, background color"

  - "src/styles.css - swimlane CSS, grid dot color override"
